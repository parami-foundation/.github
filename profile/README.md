<h1 align="center">BUILD AD3 FOR WEB3</h1>

# Introduction

Parami is short for PARA METAVERSE IDENTITY. As the next generation identity protocol based on the W3C decentralized identity standard, it is designed for metaverse and Web 3 users with self-sovereign and permissionless service.

Parami Protocol aggregates users' on-chain data and social identity information creating value with onchain reputation airdrops, which we call AD3.0, with privacy preservation in mind.

Combining with DeFi and NFT tools, Parami aims to build a human-centric SocialFi network for metaverse users.

## AD Privacy

The AD Privacy Layer provides a unique personal crypto advertising preference (PCAP) profile attached to each users DID containing user advertising privacy management services. The PCAP profile is designed to allow users to receive payments and manage their user preference data. The preserved data can be used but can not be seen, allowing the user to maintain full ownership over their data.

## AD Oracle

The decentralized oracle is designed for collecting data from the conventional Internet. It is built as part of the Substrate Offchain Worker(OCW) and specifically works for AD verification with low fees and fast response times.

# Projects
